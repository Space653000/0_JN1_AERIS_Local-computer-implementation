"""P5.4-adjacent: broaden regression coverage for shared-catalog skills
across multiple points in their input space, without touching the
single-fixture-per-skill contract in cases.py/catalog.py (see
docs/AERIS_P5_ENGINEER_FACTORY.md's P5.4 section for why that contract is
not safely extensible in a single tick). Each skill's existing
golden/engineering/*/*/golden.json checks exactly one analytic point;
these tests independently re-derive the same physical formula and check
it holds at several other points, catching a regression that a single
fixed point could miss (e.g. a sign error that only shows up off a
convenient round number)."""
